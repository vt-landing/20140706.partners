        Creating Pages with the automatic generator
            http://vt-landing.github.io/20140706.partners
          After your GitHub Pages site is generated, you can get a local copy of its HTML code. If you generated a Project Pages site, fetch and check out the new branch:
                $ cd repository
                $ git fetch origin
                $ git checkout gh-pages
        Add content and push
          In order to trigger a build when you push to your Page's repository, you must first verify your email address.
          Now you have an empty working directory. You can create some content in this branch and push it to GitHub. For example:
                $ echo "My GitHub Page" > index.html
                $ git add index.html
                $ git commit -a -m "First pages commit"
                $ git push origin gh-pages
